    <h2>Ziwen Teuber</h2>
    <p>Senior Researcher<br>Applied Developmental & Educational Psychology</p>
    <p> 
      Hello and welcome! My name is Ziwen Teuber. I am a Senior Researcher in the Department of Behavioral and Cognitive Sciences 
      at the University of Luxembourg, where I also hold PhD supervision rights. From our campus in Belval, 
      I lead the FNR CORE project "Unpacking Parental Involvement in Challenging Achievement Situations" (UPICAS) as its 
      principal investigator.
      
      My journey to Luxembourg began in Germany, where I earned my BSc and MSc degrees in Psychology between 2011 and 2016, 
      and completed my PhD in Psychology at Bielefeld University in 2021. During my doctoral studies, I investigated school 
      burnout among Chinese and German school students that sparked my broader interest in how young people navigate pressure,
      expectations, and emotional demands. Since then, my research has taken a more family-centered direction. 
      I am particularly fascinated by how everyday parent–child interactions shape well-being and development, 
      and how evidence-based tools can help families handle the challenges they encounter.
      
      I draw on frameworks from multiple psychological subdisciplines and apply rigorous methodologies to address 
      contemporary challenges in education, family life, and society. I have multi-sectoral experience and aim to use 
      my knowledge in science, praxis, and political communication to impact research and society. Furthermore, I actively 
      support Open Science by preregistering all studies before data collection and openly sharing research materials with 
      the scientific community.
      
      I am currently co-editing the "Handbook of Educational Psychology" with Nadine Spörer (University of Potsdam) 
      and Samuel Greiff (Technical University of Munich), to be published by Springer. The handbook is scheduled for 
      release in autumn 2027.
