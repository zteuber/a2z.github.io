  <p>
    Welcome! The a2z Lab was born from the curiosity of two researchers, Ziwen Teuber and Anke Weber, psychologists with PhDs from 
    Germany. Founded in the Department of Behavioral and Cognitive Sciences 
     at the University of Luxembourg, we study how children, adolescents, and families navigate life and learning. 
    At a2z Lab, research meets real life; every study uncovers insights to better understand human development and strengthen 
    family connections.

    <h2>Ziwen Teuber, Dr. rer. nat.</h2>
    <p>Founder, Senior Researcher and Facilitator</p>
    <p> 
      My name is Ziwen Teuber. I am a Senior Researcher holding PhD supervision rights. 
      I also lead the FNR CORE project "Unpacking Parental Involvement in Challenging Achievement Situations" (UPICAS).
      </p>
      <p>
      My journey to Luxembourg began in Germany, where I earned my BSc and MSc degrees in Psychology between 2011 and 2016, 
      and completed my PhD in Psychology at Bielefeld University in 2021. During my doctoral studies, I investigated school 
      burnout among Chinese and German school students that sparked my broader interest in how young people navigate pressure,
      expectations, and emotional demands. Since then, my research has taken a more family-centered direction. 
      I am particularly fascinated by how everyday parent–child interactions shape well-being and development, 
      and how evidence-based tools can help families handle the challenges they encounter.
        </p>
      <p>
      I draw on frameworks from multiple psychological subdisciplines and apply rigorous methodologies to address 
      contemporary challenges in education, family life, and society. I have multi-sectoral experience and aim to use 
      my knowledge in science, praxis, and political communication to impact research and society.
      I am currently co-editing the "Handbook of Educational Psychology" with Nadine Spörer (University of Potsdam) 
      and Samuel Greiff (Technical University of Munich), to be published by Springer. The handbook is scheduled for 
      release in autumn 2027.

    <h2>Anke Weber, Dr. phil.</h2>
    <p>Founder, Researcher</p>
    <p>
      My name is Anke Weber. I am a Researcher. My research focuses on developmental and educational psychology, with a particular 
      interest in family interactions and child development. 
      
      I collaborate closely with international researchers and local practitioners to explore evidence-based interventions 
      that enhance well-being and learning outcomes. My work combines rigorous research methodologies with practical 
      applications, aiming to impact both science and society.
